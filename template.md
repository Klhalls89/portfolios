# (Kristen Hallstrom) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

After learning I had to repeat mod 1,  I set out to work my ass off! I vowed to improve my work ethic, my time managment skills and my study habbits. I reorganized my schedule and utilized pomodoro techniques. I got to school sooner and stayed later. I worked for more hours at night. I held my self accountable for going to bed on time and waking up on time. I was dedicated to being a leader when ever possible in my new cohort.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed!!!!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects were some of my hardest and some of my biggest learning opportunities. Through my static compositions I pushed myself through the ins and outs of css, flexbox and grid.  I was super excited to master nested grids. I learned some exciting JS refactors on my final project.

Porficient scores over all!

## C: Group Work & Projects

My group projects were enoumous learning opportunities for me. I was lucky both times, to have partners who were willing to sit down and write every function together so we could both learn javaScript. These two projects improved my js understanding ten fold.

#### (Number Guesser Doubles)

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
I tried to help fellow mod 1 folks whenever possible. I was also very open with other people in my mod about what it was like repeating. When ever I could support my cohort mates I did.
